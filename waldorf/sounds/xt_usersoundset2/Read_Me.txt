Dear Microwave II/XT/XTk User,

* xt_forum2.mid
   This file contains the new forum 2 soundset as a Standard Midi File. 


* xt_forum2.lib
  This file contains the new forum 2 soundset as a Sounddiver  library file for the XT adaption 


* mw2_forum2.lib
  This file contains the new forum 2 soundset as a Sounddiver  library file for the 
  Microwave II adaption.


* xt_forum2.pdf
  This file contains information and the sound name list for the forum 2 soundset  as a PDF     
  (you have to install Acrobat Reader 3.0 or later).


 To avoid problems during the upload of the forum 2 soundset, we recommend
 the following procedure:


 - please backup *ALL* you own data of the MWII/XT/XTk by Midi Dump to your computer
  *BEFORE* transmitting the new soundeset. The new set will overwrite *ALL* existing   
   sounds, multis, RAM wavetables and waves !!
 - start the transmission of the new forum 2 soundset 


To dump the Sound Set to the Microwave II (or XT / XTk):


1. Connect the MIDI Out of the sender with the MIDI In of the Microwave II.
2. Set the Device ID of the Microwave to 0. You can find this setting in the Global menu.
3. Open the Sound Set file with the computer/sequencer.
4. Make sure that the computer/sequencer isn't set to a sort of "Cycle Mode", turn
    off any "Metronomes", MIDI Clock and set the part or track to the right MIDI output.
5. Play the file back. On sequencers, the standard Play function works most of the time.
    If not, consult the manual of the soft- or hardware.
6. When you read the message "Reorganizing memory. Please wait..." on the Microwave II,
    just proceed to send the file until it's finished. Afterwards, play the file back
    again until you don't get this message anymore. Only then all data was received
    completely by the Microwave II. Maybe slow down the tempo of the playback, too.



Now have fun with the new forum 2 soundset !
